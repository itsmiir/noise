This is a place for me to dump all the things that I have learned about noise. It's here for three reasons:
- To enhance my own understanding by writing down (regurgitating) information I have learned.
- To serve as a reference to me, in order to retain my knowledge.
- To serve as a place for me to link people to if I want to explain a particular noise topic.
If you're here and you're not me, I hope this repository helps. You should start by reading `intro.md`.
